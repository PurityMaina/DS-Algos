#Lists are enclosed in brackets:
l = [1, 2, "a"]
print(l)
#Tuples are enclosed in parentheses:
t = (1, 2, "a")
print(t)
#Tuples are faster and consume less memory.

#Dictionaries are built with curly brackets:
d = {"a":1, "b":2}
print(d)

#Sets are made using the set() builtin function
s = set([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(s)
